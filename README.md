## About CKB
CKB is the layer 1 of Nervos Network, a public/permissionless blockchain. CKB uses [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) and [improved Nakamoto concensus](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/breaking-the-throughput-limit-of-nakamoto-consensus-ccdf65fe0832) to achieve maximized performance on average hardware and internet condition, without sacrificing decentralization and security which are the core value of blockchain.

# CKB Explorer
CKB Explorer is a [Nervos CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb) blockchain explorer built with React and Ruby on Rails.

It supports searching block, transaction, address and includes two parts: [frontend](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-explorer-frontend)
and [backend server](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-explorer) (this project).

A blockchain explorer service of [Nervos CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb).

## Prerequisites

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 14.3
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) 6+
- [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/installation)
- [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git)

## Initial Project

```shell
$ cd ckb-explorer/
$ cp .env.example .env # (in this config file, please modify the items according to your local environment)
$ touch .env.local # (overwrite `.env` config if you need in `.env.local`, such as DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD...)
$ touch config/settings.local.yml # (overwrite `config/settings.yml` to config available hosts)
$ bin/setup
```

## Create & Setup database

```shell
bundle exec rake db:create                     # (create db for development and test)
bundle exec rake db:schema:load                # (run migration for development db)
bundle exec rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test # (run migration for test db)
```

## Running Test

```shell
$ bundle exec rails test
```

## Run Project

```shell
$ bundle exec rails s

# start sync process
$ ruby lib/ckb_block_node_processor.rb
```

## Deploy

We suggest using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) to deploy the CKB Explorer Service.

### Build Docker Image

```shell
$ docker compose build .
```

### Start Services

The service is composed of 4 processes:

- web: for serving the API
- worker: for processing background job
- blocksyncer: for synchronizing the data from CKB chain
- scheduler: for scheduling some timer tasks

You can see these processes in the `Procfile` file.
The `web` & `worker` process can be scaled horizontally. And the blocksyncer and scheduler process are both singleton,
so you can only start one instance for each process.

```shell
$ docker compose up -d
```
