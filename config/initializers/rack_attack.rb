class Rack::Attack
  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blocklisting and
  # safelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle("req/ip", limit: 1500, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.env['HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP'] || req.ip # unless req.path.start_with?('/assets')
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_responder = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end
  #
  self.throttled_responder =
    lambda do |env|
      match_data = env["rack.attack.match_data"]
      now = match_data[:epoch_time]

      headers = {
        "RateLimit-Limit" => match_data[:limit].to_s,
        "RateLimit-Remaining" => "0",
        "RateLimit-Reset" => (now + (match_data[:period] - now % match_data[:period])).to_s
      }

      [429, headers, ["Throttled\n"]]
    end
end
